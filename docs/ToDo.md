## Python

### Present Libs 
 - aprslib 0.7.0
 - aprs 7.0.0
 - kiss (dr-kiss)
   - TCPAsyncKISS (used in ws-client.py - Connects to KISS(tcp) and relays to websocket to remote server asyncio!)
   - Added TCP Timeout onto TCPKISS class (not used in this project, likely a failed experiment)

 - 2023-04-08 look into aprs3/kiss3 to replace present aprs libs
   - Presently has ASYNC (good or bad?)
   - Maintained with some new tests! (Where are my *own* tests?...)
